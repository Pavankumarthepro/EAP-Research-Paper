Overview

This research paper explores the significance of sustainable product design using additive manufacturing (AM) compared to conventional design methods. The study highlights how AM reduces material waste, promotes the circular economy, and optimizes mechanical design by integrating recycled plastics and advanced manufacturing techniques.

Research Questions

How can mechanical design engineers use additive manufacturing to reduce plastic waste in industry?

What are the best methods for designing products to reduce plastic waste?

How do sustainable design methods overcome conventional design methods?


Key Findings

Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the use of recycled plastics in 3D printing, reducing landfill waste.
Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) optimizes material usage, minimizes production waste, and enhances sustainability.
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) support sustainable manufacturing by integrating recycled thermoplastics such as PLA, HDPE, and PP composites.
Lightweight and complex geometries achievable through AM contribute to material efficiency and cost reduction.
Challenges include recycling costs, structural limitations, and material integrity, but ongoing research is addressing these issues.


Conclusion
The study underscores the potential of additive manufacturing to drive sustainable product design and environmental conservation. By reducing plastic waste, enhancing recycling practices, and improving design methodologies, AM offers a viable path toward a greener and more efficient manufacturing industry.
